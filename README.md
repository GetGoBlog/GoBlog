GoBlog was our entry for the 2016 GopherGala -- now it's a powerful blogging platform which is actively in development. Try it out live at www.goblog.pw

GoBlog is a platform for easily deploying your own blog. We are powered by [Voyage](https://github.com/GetGoBlog/Voyage), a blog engine written in Go which is compatible with Ghost themes.

# Why GoBlog?

We provide a platform for bloggers to write freely from around the world. We provide each user with an unlimited number of blogs, unlimited page views and storage, premium DDOS protection, a CDN, and custom theme support. Our implementation of this platform is almost entirely in Go with server configuration handled by bash.

# Why Journey?

We chose Journey as our base because it is a powerful blogging engine fully compatible with Ghost [themes](http://marketplace.ghost.org/). Transitioning over to it is easy.
