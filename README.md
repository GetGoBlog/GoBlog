GoBlog is a platform for easily deploying your own blog. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. SSL/TLS via Let's Encrypt.

# Why GoBlog?

We provide a platform for bloggers to write freely from around the world. We provide each user with an unlimited number of blogs, unlimited page views and storage, premium DDOS protection, a CDN, and custom theme support. Our implementation of this platform is almost entirely in Go with server configuration handled by bash.

# Why Journey?

We chose Journey as our base because it is a powerful blogging engine fully compatible with Ghost [themes](http://marketplace.ghost.org/). Transitioning over to it is easy.
